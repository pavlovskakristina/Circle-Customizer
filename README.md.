# Circle Customizer

## Description
This project is a Python-based application that combines Tkinter and the Turtle graphics library.
It allows users to input custom parameters (specifically degrees of rotation) to create unique, colorful circle patterns using Turtle.


The application first opens a user-friendly graphical interface where the user inputs the desired degree increment for drawing circles.
Upon submission, the Turtle window opens and generates vibrant, randomized color patterns based on the given parameter.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Simple and intuitive interface built using Tkinter.
- **Custom Parameters**: Users can input custom degrees of rotation for drawing circles.
- **Randomized Colors**: Generates circles with random RGB colors, resulting in unique and artistic designs every time.
- **Easy to Use**: Just enter a number and click to instantly see your colorful creation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries: `turtle`, `tkinter`, and `random` (all included in Python standard distribution)

## Example
- If you input "5", the Turtle will draw circles rotating 5 degrees at a time, creating a complete and symmetrical colorful pattern.
